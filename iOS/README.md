SmileZone
=========
An app to learn about working with Objective-C and servers.

The Smile Zone is an idea I’ve had for about half a year now but haven’t been able to work on because of time and other commitments.  The Smile Zone is a location based social networking game similar to Foursquare but instead of checking into locations you log smiles.  For example lets say you are walking down the street and you happen to see a stranger and smile at them.  If they smile back you would log that as 3 points, if they nod back 2 points, or if they say hi 1 point. 

 Could track the GPS information and calculate where the happiest places are in a given city.  There would be leaderboards where you could compete with your friends, messaging, and awards similar to badges in foursquare.

Some problems you may thing of are how do we trust that people are actually getting valid smiles.  Similar to with Fourquare(the old version before swarm was introducted) we could limit people to how many smiles they log in a given time or location.  Another idea would be to use Google Glass and verify the person you are looking at is indeed smiling.

I would like to develop this for an iPhone and write the backend using Python, Node, Go, or something similar.
